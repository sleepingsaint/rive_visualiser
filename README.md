# Rive Visualiser

I made this flutter project to learn how to implement Rive animations particulary how to use Rive State Machine Feature in flutter.

This project is a showcase of some selected Rive animations implemented using Rive's Flutter runtime.

* All the animation creaters and app icon creators have been attributed.

## Prerequisites
